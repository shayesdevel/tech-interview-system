# Quality Gates - {PROJECT_NAME}

**Purpose**: Mandatory checkpoints all agents must pass before committing, merging, and completing work.

**Scope**: Applies to ALL agents (Backend, Frontend, Testing, Database, DevOps, Docs, Orchestrator)

---

## Gate 1: Pre-Flight Check (BEFORE Starting Work)

### Tool Verification
- [ ] Required tools installed and accessible:
  ```bash
  {VALIDATION_COMMAND_1}  # Example: python3 --version
  {VALIDATION_COMMAND_2}  # Example: node --version
  {VALIDATION_COMMAND_3}  # Example: mvn --version
  ```

### Workspace Validation
- [ ] Working in correct directory (worktree for specialists, main repo for orchestrator)
- [ ] Verify location: `pwd` shows expected path
- [ ] On correct branch: `git branch --show-current`
- [ ] Clean starting state: `git status` (commit or stash existing changes)

### Documentation Access
- [ ] Can access quality gates: `ls ../../docs/00-active/quality-gates.md`
- [ ] Can access cognitive framework: `ls {PATH_TO_COGNITIVE_FRAMEWORK}`
- [ ] Can access project docs: `ls {PROJECT_DOCS_PATH}`

**If ANY pre-flight check fails: STOP and report error before starting work**

## Gate 2: During Development (Continuous Monitoring)

### File Hygiene (Check with `git status` frequently)
Prevent committing:
- ❌ Binary files: `.class`, `.jar`, `.pyc`, `.exe`, `.dll`
- ❌ Generated files: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `target/`, `__pycache__/`
- ❌ IDE files: `.idea/`, `.vscode/` (unless project-standard), `.DS_Store`
- ❌ Secrets: `.env`, `credentials.json`, API keys, passwords
- ❌ Large files: `>1MB` (use Git LFS if needed)

**Validation command**:
```bash
git status --porcelain | grep -E "{BINARY_FILE_PATTERN}"  # Should return empty
```

### Documentation Sync
- [ ] If you modify code, update relevant README/docs
- [ ] If you add files, ensure they're documented in appropriate README
- [ ] If you remove files, remove references from docs

**Validation command**:
```bash
# Check for broken README references (manual review)
grep -r "{YOUR_DELIVERABLE_PATTERN}" {PROJECT_DOCS_PATH}
```

---

## Gate 3: Pre-Commit Validation (BEFORE `git commit`)

### Build Verification
- [ ] Build succeeds (or document why skipped):
  ```bash
  {BUILD_COMMAND}  # Example: mvn clean install
  {BUILD_COMMAND}  # Example: npm run build
  {BUILD_COMMAND}  # Example: make build
  ```

### Test Verification
- [ ] Tests pass (or document why skipped):
  ```bash
  {TEST_COMMAND}  # Example: mvn test
  {TEST_COMMAND}  # Example: npm test
  {TEST_COMMAND}  # Example: pytest
  ```

### Code Quality (if applicable)
- [ ] Linting passes:
  ```bash
  {LINT_COMMAND}  # Example: eslint src/
  {LINT_COMMAND}  # Example: mvn checkstyle:check
  {LINT_COMMAND}  # Example: mypy .
  ```

### Git Hygiene
- [ ] **NO binary/generated files in `git status`**
- [ ] **NO secrets in commit** (.env, credentials, API keys)
- [ ] Meaningful commit message following project convention
- [ ] Verify changes: `git diff --cached` (review what you're committing)

### Documentation Validation
- [ ] README references to your deliverables are accurate
- [ ] No broken links in documentation you modified
- [ ] Code comments added for complex logic

### Session Journal (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Session journal entry created**: `docs/00-active/journal/{SESSION_FILE}`
- [ ] Journal includes: What was accomplished, decisions made, blockers encountered
- [ ] See D014 protocol: `{PATH_TO_D014_QUICK_REF}`

**If ANY pre-commit check fails: Fix before committing**

---

## Gate 4: Pre-Merge Validation (BEFORE PR merge)

### Integration Testing
- [ ] All CI/CD checks passing
- [ ] No merge conflicts with base branch
- [ ] Branch rebased or merged with latest base
- [ ] Integration tests pass (if applicable):
  ```bash
  {INTEGRATION_TEST_COMMAND}
  ```

### Cross-Reference Check
- [ ] Changes don't break other agents' work
- [ ] API contracts maintained (if backend changed endpoints, frontend updated)
- [ ] Database migrations applied (if schema changed)

### Documentation Handoff
- [ ] PR description explains what changed and why
- [ ] Links to relevant GitHub issues
- [ ] Session journal referenced in PR for context

### Quality Review
- [ ] Code review requested (if multi-developer project)
- [ ] Validation gates explicitly confirmed in PR comments
- [ ] Test coverage maintained or improved

**If ANY pre-merge check fails: Block PR merge until resolved**

---

## Gate 5: Post-Merge Verification (AFTER PR merged)

### Tracking Updates
- [ ] GitHub issue status updated (closed or commented)
- [ ] Relevant project docs updated (SPRINT.md, NEXT.md, etc.)
- [ ] Session journal confirms task completion

### Environment Validation
- [ ] Main branch builds successfully after merge
- [ ] Integration environment still functional (if applicable)
- [ ] Database migrations applied (if backend changes merged):
  ```bash
  {MIGRATION_COMMAND}  # Example: alembic upgrade head
  ```

### Orchestrator Verification (D009)
- [ ] Verify commits exist: `git log {BRANCH} --oneline -5`
- [ ] Verify PR exists and closed: `gh pr view {PR_NUMBER}`
- [ ] Worktree clean: `cd {WORKTREE} && git status`

**If post-merge verification fails: Rollback or hotfix immediately**
